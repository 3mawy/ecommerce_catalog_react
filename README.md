# E-commerce Catalog Project Documentation

## Introduction
The E-commerce Catalog project is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing product catalogs in an online store. This documentation outlines the project's structure, key features, technologies and solutions implemented.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
    - `app/`: Contains the store config and rtk hooks.
        - `hooks.ts`: Central hub for re-exporting pre-typed Redux hooks.
    - `components/`: Contains UI components.
    - `features/`: Contains feature-specific logic and components.

## Key Features
